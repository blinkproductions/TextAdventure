  storyText: 'It is pitch black. The cold surrounds you. You hear a faint sound becoming
    louder and louder. What started off as light gentle chimes started to slowly become
    rolling thunders. Your heart is racing...


    The wind starts to roar. Lightning bolts starts striking the ground. It was as
    if you are a giant lightning rod. You start sweating which only makes you more
    conductive.


    1. Start running!

    2. Freeze in fear and accept your fate. How can you outrun mother nature?'
